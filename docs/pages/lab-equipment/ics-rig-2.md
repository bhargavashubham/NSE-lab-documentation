# S7-1200 ICS rig

This document serves as a guide for the rig installation with brief description of the devices associated in this setup. It also provides an overview on what hacks are possible and how these devices can be hacked. For detailed description of ICS architecture and hacking, please refer to [Industrial Control Systems](**Link**)

## Rig setup

This setup shows a convergence of legacy Operational Technology (OT)and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, legacy devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Remote Terminal Units (RTU) interact and exchange data with the IoT devices via IIoT gateways [A Reference Architecture for IIoT and Industrial Control Systems Testbeds](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/186781375/CameraReady_A_Reference_Architecture_for_IIoT_and_Industrial_Control_Systems_Testbeds.pdf). There is very little understood / known about the attack surfaces and potential vulnerabilities of these covergent OT/IoT environemnts, which is also a big motivation for this setup. 

The setup consists of the following:
